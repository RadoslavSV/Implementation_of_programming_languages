In the genie.lua project, a new target named 'myGarbageCollector' is added, which is a ConsoleApp written in C++. The target consists of a single source file './src/myGarbageCollector.cpp'. It also links to the 'test_bench' static library. The setup function is called to set up the common flags and defines for the project.
